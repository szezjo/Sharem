Simple file syncing app

# What is Sharem for?
Sharem is simple app that allows users to login and share their files to others. Users can choose to what people they want to share which files. A person who runs server can also see contents of users' folders, but they can't download them.

# Running an app
To run a precompiled app you need Java 14 (version 58.0). If you have installed, then just double-click JAR files in Exec folder. You can also run these through terminal by using a command `` java -jar Server.jar `` for server (and Client.jar for client)

# Compiling
The application was made with IntelliJ IDEA and that's why using it should be the easier method to compile it. If you want to compile it through CLI or with other methods, just remember that your method must support IDEA forms.

# Why Sharem was made?
It was made as a part of university labs to learn how to create GUI network application - it was the first try, so bear in mind that it's relatively simple and the code is - I bet - spaghetti one.
